# Travel and Weather

### Why does this exist?
I wanted a thing that i could glance at and know whether to take the car, bike, or not even go into work at all dependant on weather and traffic.


### What do I need for this to work?
This uses google API for maps, traffic and directions. Full list below:
- Directions API					
- Geocoding API					
- Google Cloud APIs					
- Google Cloud Storage JSON API					
- Maps JavaScript API					
- Routes API

It also requires Openweather API
